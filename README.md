# Images without dimensions 
One of the most CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) Problem is "Image elements have no explicit width and height"

## Summary
Always include width and height size attributes on your images and video elements. Alternatively, reserve the required space with CSS aspect ratio boxes. This approach ensures that the browser can allocate the correct amount of space in the document while the image is loading.
## Solution
With this simpel sVanilia JavaScript all images add the attribut width and height of this Image at DOMContentLoaded
